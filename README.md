# Miscellaneous Python Scripts

A collection of Python scripts created during my learning and experimentation with Python, as well as code to help automate tasks and solve problems at work.

---

## Folders & Scripts

### `swap-two-numbers-without-temp/`
A simple script to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable, using arithmetic operations.

---

### `name-filter-excel/`
Reads an Excel file (`file_name.xlsx`) and filters names.  
The filtered results are saved to `output.xlsx`.

---

### `compare-text-files/`
Compares two text files line by line using a simple tkinter GUI and displays the differences along with the line numbers.  
If both files are identical, it reports that no differences were found.

## Requirements

Only required for the `name_filter_excel` script:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
